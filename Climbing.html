Rock climbing is an activity in which participants climb up, down or across natural rock formations or artificial rock walls. The goal is to reach the summit of a
formation or the endpoint of a usually pre-defined route without falling. Due to the length and extended endurance required and because accidents are more likely
to happen on descent than ascent, Rock Climbers do not usually climb back down the route. It is very rare for a climber to downclimb, especially on the larger multiple
pitches (class III- IV and /or multi-day grades IV-VI climbs). Professional Rock climbing competitions have the objectives of either completing the route in the
quickest possible time or attaining the farthest point on an increasingly difficult route. Scrambling, another activity involving the scaling of hills and similar
formations, is similar to rock climbing. However, rock climbing is generally differentiated by its sustained use of hands to support the climber's weight as
well as to provide balance.
<p>
Rock climbing is a physically and mentally demanding sport, one that often tests a climber's strength, endurance, agility and balance along with mental control.
It can be a dangerous activity and knowledge of proper climbing techniques and usage of specialised climbing equipment is crucial for the safe completion of
routes. Because of the wide range and variety of rock formations around the world, rock climbing has been separated into several different styles and sub-disciplines.

<section>
  <b><br id="Aid climbing">Aid climbing</br></b>
  Still the most popular method of climbing big walls, aid climbers make progress up a wall by repeatedly placing and weighting gear that is used directly to aid
  ascent and enhance safety.

  <b><br id="Free climbing">Free climbing</br></b>
  The most commonly used method to ascend climbs refers to climbs where the climber's own physical strength and skill are relied on to accomplish the climb. Free climbing
  may rely on top rope belay systems, or on lead climbing to establish protection and the belay stations. Anchors, ropes and protection are used to back up the climber and
  are passive as opposed to active ascending aids. Subtypes of free climbing are trad climbing and sport climbing. Free climbing is generally done as "clean lead" meaning
  no pitons or pins are used as protection.

<section>
  <b><br id="Bouldering">Bouldering</br></b>
  Climbing on short, low routes without the use of the safety rope that is typical of most other styles. Protection, if used at all, typically consists of a cushioned
  bouldering pad below the route and a spotter, a person who watches from below and directs the fall of the climber away from hazardous areas. Bouldering may be an arena
  for intense and relatively safe competition, resulting in exceptionally high difficulty standards.

  <b><br id="Deep-water soloing (DWS)">Deep-water soloing (DWS)</br></b>
  Deep-water soloing (or psicobloc) is similar to free soloing in that the climber is unprotected and without a rope, but should the climber fall, it is into deep
  water instead of onto the ground.
  <a href='#top'>Back to Top</a>
</section>

<section>
  <b><br id="Free soloing">Free soloing</br></b>
  Free soloing, referred to as "soloing" in the UK, is single-person climbing without the use of any rope or protection system whatsoever. If a fall occurs
  and the climber is not over water (as in the case of deep water soloing), the climber is likely to be killed or seriously injured. Though technically similar
  to bouldering, free solo climbing typically refers to routes that are far taller and/or far more lethal than bouldering. The term "highball" is used to refer to
  climbing on the boundary between free soloing and bouldering, where what is usually climbed as a boulder problem may be high enough for a fall to cause serious injury
  (20 ft. and higher) and hence could also be considered to be a free solo.

<section>
  <b><br id="Roped solo climbing">Roped solo climbing</br></b>
  Solo climbing with a rope secured at the beginning of the climb allowing a climber to self-belay as they advance. Once the pitch is completed the soloist
  must descend the rope to retrieve their gear, and then reclimb the pitch. This form of climbing can be conducted free or as a form of aid climbing.

  <b><br id="Lead climbing">Lead climbing</br></b>
  Lead climbing is a climbing technique. The lead climber ascends with the rope passing through intermittent anchors that are below them, rather than through a
  top anchor, as in a top-roped climb. A partner belays from below the lead climber, by feeding out enough rope to allow upward progression without undue slack. As the
  leader progresses he or she clips the rope into, using a runner and carabiners, intermediate points of protection such as active cams, or passive protection such
  as nuts; this limits the length of a potential fall. The leader also may clip into pre-placed bolts. Indoor gyms might have short runners pre-attached to fixed anchor
  points in the wall.
  <p>
  Unlike top-rope climbing where the climber is always supported by an anchor located above the climber, lead climbing often has scenarios where the climber will be attached
  to a point under him or her. In these cases, if the climber were to fall, the distance fallen would be much greater than that of top-rope and this is one of the main
  reasons lead climbing can be dangerous. The fall factor is the ratio of the height a climbers falls and the length of rope available to absorb the fall. The higher the
  fall factor, the more force placed on the climber as the ropes decelerates them. The maximum fall factor is 2. It is often advised that climbers who are interested in lead
  climbing should learn from experienced climbers and participate in training sessions before actually lead climbing on their own.

  <b><br id="Multi-pitch climbing">Multi-pitch climbing</br></b>
  The climbing rope is of a fixed length; the climber can only climb the length of the rope. Routes longer than the rope length are broken up into several segments
  called pitches; this is known as multi-pitch climbing. At the top of a pitch, the leader, the first climber to ascend, sets up an anchor and then belays the second
  climber up to the anchor; as the second climber follows the route taken by the leader, the second climber removes (cleans) the carabiners and anchors placed along the way
  in order to use them again on the next pitch. Once both climbers are at the top anchor, the leader begins climbing the next pitch and so on until the top of the route is reached.
  In either case, upon completion of a route, climbers can walk back down if an alternate descent path exists, or rappel (abseil) down with the rope.

  <b><br id="Sport climbing">Sport climbing</br></b>
  Unlike traditional rock climbing, sport climbing involves the use of protection (bolts) placed with power drills or on rappel or permanent anchors which are
  attached to the rock walls. This is separate from bolted trad face climbing.

<section>
  <b><br id="Traditional climbing">Traditional climbing</br></b>
  Traditional or trad climbing involves rock climbing routes in which protection against falls is placed by the climber while ascending, or bolts placed on lead.
  Gear is used to protect against falls but not to aid the ascent directly. Traditional bolted face climbs are different than sport climbs. Trad bolted climbs use either a
  hand drill and or are bolted on lead. This means there are far less bolts and they are spaced out farther than sport climbs.

  <b><br id="Bottom rope climbing and top rope climbing">Bottom rope climbing and top rope climbing</br></b>
  Commonly known as "Top Roping": belaying a climber from the ground or the base of the route. A belay system resembling a pulley in which an anchor has been created
  at the top of a climb, through which the rope runs through from the belayer on the ground, to the climber on the ground (position before starting the climb). The rope
  is "taken-in", to clear up the slack as the climber moves upwards, so in the event of a fall the climber falls the shortest distance possible. The length of a fall is
  normally no more than a meter, but can vary depending on the length of the route (the longer the rope, the more stretch the rope will undergo when weighted) and the
  weight of the climber compared to that of the belayer, among other things.
